    <p>Irish soda bread is a type of quick bread that relies on baking soda, not yeast, to rise. 
        The bread contains buttermilk, which contains lactic acid. The acid reacts with the baking soda 
        to create air bubbles, resulting in a perfectly risen dough.</p>

    <p>Soda bread became incredibly common during the Irish Potato Famine, 
        as you can make it with only four ingredients: 
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds potatoes, peeled and halved
            </li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes well, then return to the pot and cover with a clean dish towel. Place the pot over very low heat until potatoes are dry, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the milk and green onion in a saucepan over medium-low heat until warm, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once potatoes are dry, add butter and salt; mash with a potato masher until smooth. Stir in warm milk mixture until well combined, then season with pepper.</li>
        </ol>
